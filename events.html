											<h3>Intertech x ShoutOut fundraiser, December 2016</h3>
											<p>In line with our mission to support the LGBT community, we hosted a Christmas fundraiser for ShoutOut at Oscars Cafe Bar where we raised close to 2000 euros.
												<p><a href="http://www.shoutout.ie">ShoutOut</a> developed a workshop that vetted volunteers deliver on an almost weekly basis to teenagers in Irish schools – effectively training young people how to be allies. As we've all experienced, school is a damn fine place to find an ally if you're LGBTQ+.

											<h3>NO FATS / NO FEMMES, November 2016</h3>
											<p>We organized "No Fats // No Femmes" at Google Ireland, a panel discussion hosted by the organization event on the topic of LGBT equality and discrimination with David Stuart, Vivienne Errington-Barnes, and Diyadh Khalaf. </p>
											<p>"No Fats // No Femmes" is not just a common call-out to describe undesired partners who need not apply – it’s a mantra. Are these just individual sexual preferences, or do they represent racism, body shaming and homophobia that’s prevalent and unaddressed in our community?. Is marriage equality the end of the road that started with Stonewall? Are we now a nation of equals? Or are we liable to perpetuate amongst ourselves the discrimination we have suffered for decades?</p>
