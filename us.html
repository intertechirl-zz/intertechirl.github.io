												Daniel: Hailing from Hungary, Daniel had zero experience in LGBTQ activism until getting involved with Google's internal LGBTQ group in the run-up to the Marriage Equality Referendum. Now he's balancing his concerns about pinkwashing with the positive impact that corporate buy-in & support can achieve. Beside InterTech, he's on the board of the National LGBT Federation, and tries to keep up with gigs in Dublin.
