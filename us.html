												Conor; currently working in Google where I am a member of the policy team. I host some of our functions, work up new concepts for events and continue to develop our core values approach.

												Daniel "Hailing from Hungary, I had zero experience in LGBT+ activism until I got involved with Google's internal LGBT+ group in the run-up to the Marriage Equality Referendum. Though I have misgivings about corporate pinkwashing, I was impressed by how much we could achieve with the resources & the buy-in of an organisation like Google. Now I'm a member of various groups like the National LGBT Federation and InterTech – here, I’m a general dogsbody and occasional public speaker. Outside of work I try to keep up with Pitchfork, and with gigs in Dublin."
